# 🍎 Apple MCP — Personal & Family Edition

A local-only MCP server for Apple apps, built for personal and family use. Each family member runs their own instance on their Mac; iCloud Shared Albums, shared Reminders lists, and shared Notes folders keep everything in sync across devices.

Forked from [supermemoryai/apple-mcp](https://github.com/supermemoryai/apple-mcp) with one addition: **Photos** — the gap that existed in both the original and the upstream fork. Supports browsing albums, recent photos, favorites, and in-app search.

## 🤯 What Can This Thing Do?

**Basically everything you wish your Mac could do automatically (but never bothered to set up):**

### 💬 **Messages** - Because who has time to text manually?

- Send messages to anyone in your contacts (even that person you've been avoiding)
- Read your messages (finally catch up on those group chats)
- Schedule messages for later (be that organized person you pretend to be)

### 📝 **Notes** - Your brain's external hard drive

- Create notes faster than you can forget why you needed them
- Search through that digital mess you call "organized notes"
- Actually find that brilliant idea you wrote down 3 months ago

### 👥 **Contacts** - Your personal network, digitized

- Find anyone in your contacts without scrolling forever
- Get phone numbers instantly (no more "hey, what's your number again?")
- Actually use that contact database you've been building for years

### 📧 **Mail** - Email like a pro (or at least pretend to)

- Send emails with attachments, CC, BCC - the whole professional shebang
- Search through your email chaos with surgical precision
- Schedule emails for later (because 3 AM ideas shouldn't be sent at 3 AM)
- Check unread counts (prepare for existential dread)

### ⏰ **Reminders** - For humans with human memory

- Create reminders with due dates (finally remember to do things)
- Search through your reminder graveyard
- List everything you've been putting off
- Open specific reminders (face your procrastination)

### 📅 **Calendar** - Time management for the chronically late

- Create events faster than you can double-book yourself
- Search for that meeting you're definitely forgetting about
- List upcoming events (spoiler: you're probably late to something)
- Open calendar events directly (skip the app hunting)

### 🗺️ **Maps** - For people who still get lost with GPS

- Search locations (find that coffee shop with the weird name)
- Save favorites (bookmark your life's important spots)
- Get directions (finally stop asking Siri while driving)
- Create guides (be that friend who plans everything)
- Drop pins like you're claiming territory

### 📸 **Photos** - Your memories, actually findable *(added in this fork)*

- List all albums with photo counts
- Browse any album by name
- Pull up your favorites instantly
- See what's been recently added
- Search by keyword — opens Photos with results in view

## 🎭 The Magic of Chaining Commands

Here's where it gets spicy. You can literally say:

_"Read my conference notes, find contacts for the people I met, and send them a thank you message"_

And it just... **works**. Like actual magic, but with more code.

## 🚀 Installation (The Easy Way)

### Option 1: Smithery (For the Sophisticated)

```bash
npx -y install-mcp apple-mcp --client claude
```

For Cursor users (we see you):

```bash
npx -y install-mcp apple-mcp --client cursor
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup (For the Brave)

<details>
<summary>Click if you're feeling adventurous</summary>

First, get bun (if you don't have it already):

```bash
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
```

Then add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-mcp": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["--no-cache", "apple-mcp@latest"]
    }
